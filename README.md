# Zerahypt Unity Project
Zerahypt is an interactive 3D exploration program based on the worldbuilding project 'Terrahypt' created by Swedish multimedia artist Syrsa, aka; Benjamin, Dutvutan, Ruchalus and Scoutellite. This repository serves as an official public mirror for the Unity 4.7.2 project source files as well as an archive for all currently recovered standalone builds of the program.

## Contextual Information
For the indefinite future Syrsa has abandoned development on the project due to limitations with Unity 4.7.2 as a 32-bit only program. This has made him unable to rebuild Zerahypt on this current version of the engine and due to other complications, Zerahypt is also unable to be transfered to newer versions of Unity without major breakages. As it stands, Zerahypt will remain here as an open source program free for people to download and modify.

## Technical information
### Prerequisites
- Unity 4.7.2
- Blender 2.7
- Windows (Recommended)

Blender 2.7 is required for this project to be fully functional as Unity 4.7.2 is unable to use later versions of Blender to import the blend files directly due to differences in Blender's import code.

### Known Technical Issues
I can confirm that this project, once pre-initialised and imported, will run on at least Linux Mint. However any new blend files introduced or changes made to pre-existing ones will not be reimported as Unity 4.7.2 can not find Blender under the Linux environment. If not for being bound to specific versions of Blender and Unity this might have not been an issue.

There are also a few broken DV prefabs within the project which may or may not be fixed by myself or others in the future. Either these were old prefabs which were broken at some point during development of Zerahypt or new ones which Syrsa did not finalise before releasing the project.

## Content Management
Vanilla is the default canonical branch of the project and is managed by myself. Changes made to it are explicity for the purpose of fixing bugs detailed within the 'Issues' section or for adding any new features made by Syrsa himself. Any community made additions should be commited and pushed to their own branches, any attempts otherwise will be denied.
