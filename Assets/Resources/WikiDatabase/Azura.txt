Azura is a Celestial Cyrathilian who has committed her life to  serve as the patroness of
Terrahypt, protecting it from invasive alien lifeforms. She is benevolent, but her kindness
does not come before her honesty, as she does not treat fools lightly. She has been Terrana's
godmother ever since her parents have disappeared, being there for her comfort and also
being there as her right hand in some circumstances where great strength is needed.

Azura is the daughter of Yria, who was an exceedingly strong warrior from Kabrius. Like her
mother, her spiritual energy is vastly superior in comparison to other Cyrathilians. For being
the largest Thilian in Azecreas, she has special cooks who's sole career is to make meals big
enough to fill Azura's huge belly. Being a Cyrathilian with a powerful metabolism she finds no
satisfaction in small snacks. Even if she sits around and does little to nothing, her potent
body still requires a lot of energy.

Azura has a tailor made bedroom and recreational area. Her general living quarters is
located inside the top of the  Azal tower. A place with big enough hallways for her to freely
walk through without impediment. Azura is a serene being. She does not actively seek out
problems to solve. She prefers to stay together with Terrana as often as she can because
she loves her as her foster child. Laying down besides her and following her wherever she
goes. She is so large that Terrana is using one of Azura's perky breasts as a throne, which is
where she'll sit for the majority of her time, relaxing and contemplating.
