Pirizuka is a Thilian whos occupation is to explore and document her experiences. She is
among the top members within the Overseer movement, which means that she is allowed
access  to almost every area without a special pass. Though she needs some help with
navigation due to her lame sense of direction.

Pirizuka lives alone on her Zerzek which is her personal base. Over there she breeds
genetically modified bunnies that are designed to be extremely energetic. Like her parent
Corsudra, Pirizuka loves foods that physically fight back.

Being very physically active, Pirizuka has a fit body. During her free time, she likes to visit
serene places like Athnias in order to do Hyptian Meditation. Pirizuka is not very social, as
she tends to lose focus easily when she's around any kind of contraption, whether it be a
simple application or an advanced battlecruiser.

For being the child of a renowned archo-technician, Pirizuka can control any machine and
vessel she enters by just looking at the interface. She can also be pretty submissive, she can
be dragged off by someone or be told to do basic tasks like holding a box, which is a pretty
questionable trait for an overseer. But she can be told to only do so many things before
protesting. And no matter the predicament, she'll always find a way out. Which is what baffles
many, and is what earned her the overseer title.
