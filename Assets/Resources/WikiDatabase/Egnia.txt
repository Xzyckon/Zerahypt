Egnia is a Mukaiter druidess who is one of the few surviving elders who took care and rebuilt
Terrahypt after Yluxa. During Yluxa, she got blasted with archium from fissures in the ground.
This have given her a couple of extreme mutations of which she has mostly taken care of.
She has kept some of them, like her ears, lack of legs which allows her to possess a mean
pair of prosthetics, and large milk glands which despite their bulky size, prove to be very

As a druidess, she has alot of responsibilities when it comes to the Terrahyptian ecosystem.
Though, she've made her own species that take care of most of her work. Egnia as of now
have very little to do. She spends most of her time lazing around in the Azal tower. She have
made plenty of friends from her free time and spends it mostly interacting with them. She has
also gathered a small group of apprentices who seeks her teachings.

Egnia has some profound abilities. She can accelerate the growth of biological tissue, and
with her fingers she can modify the molecules of whatever substance she rubs, including
DNA. With her breasts, she can produce chemicals in bulk form as salts and acids present in
her milk. As a chemist, she can use this chemical-rich milk to create medicines, poisons and
even metals suspended in it which she can percipitate out in form of crystals that she can
later melt into ingots.
