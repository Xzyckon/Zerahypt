Lokerat is a Luttil that serves as a captain for the Obsyas, a coalition of pirate traders who
each has their own company. And Lokerat is the owner of the largest one. He is responsible
for most tech being sold, such as Flynet Barats, Azatils and various other tools that can be
fitted to a Sand Cruiser.

He has an affinity to improve and upgrade already existing vessels with tools in order to
make them survive longer in the agrian deserts. He made Herea an entire Sand Cruiser from
scratch which he took out for a test run. He installed a new Azatil on it which he wanted to try
out when Terrahypt temporarily shut down its sun during its leave from Earth. This was to see
if it could spot potential enemies in the dark.

Lokerat takes a decent time of his day to personally fix things. It's because as a stable
authority figure, he feels the need to put himself down to the level of the commoner in order
to make himself feel relateable by maintaining the tech that his subordinates are using. And
since he likes to tinker and upgrade technology overall, he cherishes his privilege to access
his surroundings as a captain.

He is rather lucky for living in a stable community with a large number of mature people,
because as a person he is a bit gullible and absent-minded. Some say it's due to his great
consumption of beer, his favourite drink. But his intelligence has always been the same, and
he has made sure that he has a Thilian by his side to give him some reality checks when
things gets a little bit heated.
