Tyg is a celestial Cytonian who is the main domineering force of the Kabrian Omnire, creator
of the Thilian species, and the next most powerful being in Encydros, after Cythas.

She is one of Cythas' 2 successors. Unlike her sibling, Targilin, Tyg is creative, analytical and
assertive. Due to their differences, Cythas created a planet for both Tyg and Targilin where
they can focus on their future without world-shattering quarrels.

It was only recently at the discovery of humans she started to practice one of her most
notable abilities. Which is to create biological structures that doesn't come instinctively to her
as a Cytonian. With the help of the human brain and the irrational behavior it encourages in
order to preserve its existence. She has developed a personal preference for aesthetics. It
boosts her motivation for creativity which often leads to breakthroughs in her field of biology
and science.

Though being inherently Cytonian in nature, she's surprisingly whimsical. She likes to
overuse the human senses she has given herself since Cytonians originally didn't possess
any limbs to feel with. This have also made her more compassionate towards her
descendants, but indifferent towards other species.
