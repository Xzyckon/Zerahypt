Terrahyptians are the human race of Terrahypt, a vast breed of cunning and liberal people.
They once also populated their ancient homeworld Zerana that now is destroyed for eternity.
Terrahyptians seem to derive from an even more ancient world than Zerana, thus further
information is unknown because the animals on Terrahypt do not seem to have any species
closely related to them, since primates that were found on Earth were most likely to be related.
