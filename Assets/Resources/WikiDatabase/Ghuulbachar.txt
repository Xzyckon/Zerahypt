Ghuulbachar is a Druud king who rules over a colossal poturgos named Balcoran. It is
always on the move, and he is the only one who pilots it. Despite being royalty, he has a
career as a merchant. He drives his mobile city all around Terrahypt to exploit the most active
trading routes.

Ghuulbachar is huge, even for a Druud. Many believe it is due to the amount of food and
services he gets as a king. He even makes the best out of the lack of certain things by
commissioning entrepreneurs to make something new. He's the one who instigated the
conception of Snorps, a brand of cereal/crisps to replace the tiny flakes that he was stuck
with pouring into his breakfast bowl.

He's relaxed and unconcerned when it comes to hoodlums that barge in uninvited, because
there are only a handful of things that are able to pose a threat to him. He always welcomes
newcomers, even if they are from rival factions. He is merry and likes to throw small parties
with presents and alcohol. He loves people with a sense of humor and he often cracks jokes
over the radio with neighbouring towns.

But when it comes down to battles, he isn't a stranger to them. He uses his great size and
personal experience to intimidate his opponents. His strategy is to settle hostility and
disputes with tough negotiation in order to prevent further problems.
