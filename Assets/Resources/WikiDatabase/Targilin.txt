Targilin is a celestial Cytonian who is the main troublemaker of the Kabrian Omnire, creator
of the Kybrothilian species, and the third most powerful being in Encydros, after Tyg.

She is one of Cythas' 2 successors. Unlike her sibling, Tyg, Targilin is destructive, irrational
and indecisive. Due to their differences, Cythas created a planet for both Targilin and Tyg
where they can focus on their future without world-shattering quarrels.

Targilin has become infatuated with the human psyche Tyg discovered, of which she adopted
to be part of hers. As a result, she finds it hugely entertaining to watch things get destroyed
before her eyes. Although for no specific purpose, she can easily be distracted by visually
similar things. This means that she's reasonably predictable for people to survive on

This also means that she strengthens the infrastructure around her by punishing its
weakspots. As a result from this constant looming peril she imposes on her homeworld, the
Dutvutanians have grown strong and durable. Targilin is also difficult to displease, since she
has very little in terms of value to lose. And due to her partially human psyche, she
sometimes argues with herself on whether to take care of her kin during her shenanigans.
Because what she does isn't inherently detrimental in the grand scheme of things.
