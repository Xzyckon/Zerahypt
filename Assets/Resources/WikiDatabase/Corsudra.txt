Corsudra is a large Athnian Anodian breed who lives in Cyecos close to the Abyathni citadel.
She is considered the strongest Ceiphian who relies solely on physical power. Although her
parent, Loudra finds it "highly unrefined and childish". Despite this, her imposing abilities are
revered by many. Terrahyptians have even named a war vehicle brand after her.

Corsudra has been very independent during her childhood. To such a degree that she has
been living in the Corsudra mountain range for several hundred years, only obeying her own
whimsical set of rules. She has been making a name for herself and the mountains she has
lived in. Mainly due to the fact that she almost ate every species there into extinction.

She is the parent of Pirizuka and Pazuka, and L0upra's lover. Despite her mighty, menacing
appearance, she is surprisingly gentle when she approaches the members of her family.
Corsudra is fanatical when it comes to pushing her body to ever greater heights. She loves to
rip apart metal objects such as steel tethers and chains. During her every day life, she does
whatever she can to make her daily routines as physically challenging as possible. Even
when eating, she has hired biomechanics to build very powerful creatures that fight back
while she eats them.

The strength of her muscles are astonishing. She can bite a tank gun clean off, swallow it
whole, and when it's in her belly, she can use her abdominal muscles to crush it into pieces.
