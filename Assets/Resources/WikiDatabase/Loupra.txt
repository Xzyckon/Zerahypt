Loupra is a Ceiphian who works as an archo-technician. She lives in Cyecos, attending the
very few jobs that are left in her field. She used to be an outstanding individual, helping with
the construction of the numerous Zerzeks and machines that still operates in Azecreas to this

Her profession consists of building electronic architectures for archium contraptions, and
integrating said contraptions into all kinds of platforms so they work with excellent efficiency.
Loupra's great age has put her in a stagnating situation where her brilliant, but outdated line
of work is no longer needed. She can only now serve as a travelling freelancer for companies
that are still developing.

It was only after she met Corsudra that she now has a place to tinker and make her
contraptions, and that is the Corsudra company which she kickstarted. In a time of tense
martial unrest, she gets to help creating some of the most powerful war machines on

Her life with Corsudra has made a huge impact on her almost non-existant sexual drive.
Loupra has deliberately put her work area right next to Corsudra's workout hall so she can
watch her exercizing while working on her tech. With this easy access to a large, virile and
fertile Thilian, Loupra has become the proud parent of 2 healthy Thilians, Pazuka and
Pirizuka. In Pirizuka's case, Loupra has found a great drive to make even better equipment
that'll make her beloved child happy.
