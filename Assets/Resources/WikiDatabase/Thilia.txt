Thilia is the very first humanoid that Tyg created when she found out about the interesting
shape that the Humans on Earth had when she first visited the planet.

Thilia has gone through countless iterations and improvements due to her function as the
main prototype of all Thilians and their derivatives. Every Kabrian creature besides Cytonians
has their ancestry spanning all the way back to her.

She is the one that created the first Proto-Thilian, Athaian, Slisk and Proto-Cyrathilian. She
maintains these examples with great care and makes sure that they produce healthy
offspring. This care is mostly autonomic because her genes are present in every
Thilian-derived species, maintaining their unique genome so it does not corrupt into
something that isn't Thilian.

Thilia's great age and experience in everything that is related to biology and chemistry has
made her one of the most crucial individuals of the Kabrian Omnire. She loves her body and
its native abilities. And she finds great pride in the aspects that it holds and proudly
incorporates it into her descendants.

Thilia resides mainly within her great mothership which is entirely populated with her healthy
and fertile descendants, making love and offspring without end. Little is known about Thilia's
personality, but she is generally serene and gracefully cuts to the chase if there is a problem.
Being a caring parent for quadrillions is enough to make her scorn petty feuds.
