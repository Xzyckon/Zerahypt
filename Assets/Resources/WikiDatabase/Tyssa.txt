Tyssa is the first of her kind that Tygria created. Brought to life as a Tygriessa, she and her
descendants were raised as guardians and upholders of the dutvutanian civilization.

During Tyssas' millennia-long lifetime, she has been through countless wars and revolutions.
She has gained many allies and lost them. Her plethora of experiences has given her the
patience of a saint and very dilute emotions of which are much dominated by her eternal
content smile.

She is not as well-known as the other Noble procreants like her despite her long life and her
status as the parent of her kind. Her days of churning out Tygriessas are over, she's retired
and have secluded herself to a more relaxed life as a Top Overseer. She possesses her own
Zerzek, and there she spends most of her time studying geology and mineralogy since it's
one of the things that she can continue to entertain herself with without it becoming stale or

Her daily life is not without its issues. Being born a Noble, she gets IPR 
(Isolative Procreational Reflex), which is an autonomous effect that occurs whenever a Noble 
is isolated. This is because Tygriessas are a soldier species that functions best in groups. 
And since Tyssa lives by herself, her body starts producing Spawnseed that has to be isolated 
in a vacuum so it  won't develop into a Spawntree. Although she has ways to prevent IPR before
it happens with drugs. Even if having kids have their benefits, the process is too inconvenient
to live with.
