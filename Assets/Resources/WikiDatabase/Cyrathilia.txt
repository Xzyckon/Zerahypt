Cyrathilia is a Proto-Cyrathilian who branched off to become the Clanmother of all the
Cyrathilians. She lives on Raidyutan, which is her native home, spending most of her time
wandering around the open plains, enjoying the silence, and listening to the faint murmurs of

Despite being the mother of trillions, she likes to spend most of her time with herself and only
spend time with her children during specific times. When she is alone, she uses her superior
senses to watch over Raidyutan and the vicinity of space it occupies for threats. She even
doubts the protective capabilities of Tyg. Her love for her descendants is enough to make her
whole body to undergo celestial changes.

Cyrathilia is the largest known walking being in Encydros. Even the scientists of her own
species are dumbfounded from how fit and shapely her figure is despite her enormous size.
She has developed this body of hers through many thousands of years of training and
self-initiated cellular evolution. She can walk, run and jump without shattering her bones or
ripping her tissue from the sheer stress of her own mass.

She moves with a slow and refined gait, causing very little tremors in the ground. Although
she have made it clear that she doesn't want to be frequently visited, she still gets a few
onlookers that perch themselves on the cliffs. Many of which are there to simply watch in awe
as she ambulates while her colossal body undulates down the flush valleys.
