Gobnard is a Terrahyptian who lives in Loucreas. He is one of the governing aristocrats of the
second loucrean council. He works as a control personality who provides differing opinions to
benefit the idea pool of the Loucrean government.

Although he has served well enough into his second term, he is not granted as a first
loucrean council member because of his unreliability. He is unorthodox, inattentive, but he
has a remarkable ability to recall shockingly accurate, but obscure  pieces of information
about completely random things out of seemingly nowhere.

Nobody knows how he gets these eerie thoughts, and neither does Gobnard. It is a
double-edged sword since his career is providing intel for the Loucrean government, 
and most of the time he discloses completely useless information.

Gobnard lives a completely secluded life at the top floor of a tulabas adjunct building. Over
there he has countless books, dictionaries and encyclopedias of which to look through when
he gets one of his seasonal deliriums. And throughout his life, he has written down these
thoughts into massive piles of notes and pieces of paper that are scattered around his

He frequently heads out on trips to find the sources of these bits of information, and brings
with him a huge stack of notes to aid him in his endeavors. And being the absent-minded
mad man that he is, he keeps loosing large portions of it.
