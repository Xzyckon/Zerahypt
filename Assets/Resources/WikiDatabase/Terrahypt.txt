Terrahypt is a Hyptian Zerzek, created to house the scattered continental plates that were
once a part of a bigger planet called Zerana that was destroyed 3800 years ago. The
continents have been pulled together and geologically fused by skillful mages such as
Azfelgharz and Argal, creating the biggest Zerzek in Encydros.

It has its own artificial gravity, and an artificial sun that hovers above the Zerzek to sustain all
life that exists on this mobile world. The Zerzek itself is about 2,800 kilometers in length.

The continent is propelled by 4 large archo thrusters that allow it to travel through space and
avoid dangerous threats like rogue celestial bodies.
