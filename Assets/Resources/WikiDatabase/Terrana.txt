Terrana is the Empress of the Kabrian satellite state, Terrahypt. She is a rare breed of Thilian
of which she's the only one of.

Her coronation as the Empress of Terrahypt stems from the fact that she's an extremely
stubborn and clever being. She was found to not have any parents upon her discovery. So
she had to do a lot of the learning and interactions herself during her upbringing.

Now as a royal, she has the privilege of enforcing her philosophy over Terrahypt, and pull its
people out of the Yluxian dark ages. Her talents are also impressive, her ability to control
Archium is as great as a celestial Cyrathilian. She doesn't necessarily have the strength or
the strong body tissue of a Cyrathilian, but she can maintain her form relatively intact
throughout her full energy surge. She can fly and hurl plasma with ease.

As a ruler, Terrana has little empathy for other Thilians, though she has a large sense of
sympathy which makes her very austere. Terrana also has an inflated sense of pride. She
covers herself as little as possible to show off her "Phenomenal body". And she performs
every bodily task as extravagantly as possible to display her dominance. This is mainly for
self-gratification. But it also works as a way to intimidate people where she'll emit
disproportionately deep sounds for her small stature.
