A Zerzek is a mobile body mainly made out of rock or any structural substance of which is
used as a medium to build on or into. They are usually large enough to house entire buildings
or towns where people live. Zerzeks fly or float with the help of exotic matter that falls in the
opposite direction of normal gravity. These forms of matter can be found in the rocks of
Cyecos where most of these Zerzeks are manufactured.

Zerzek also come in sizes ranging up to several thousand kilometers. These go by the
definition "Hyptian Zerzeks" of which Terrahypt is one of. For a Zerzek to be hyptian, it needs
to be at least 200 kilometers across at any angle so it can contain the basic Agrian
machinery in order to sustain it.
