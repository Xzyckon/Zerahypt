Alia is an Edmyron, the first of her kind. Her birth occured on Earth when Terrahypt was at its
closest during the Terrahyptian dark ages. The mutated sprygin that carried her, shielded Alia
from atmospheric entry and impact. She crashed down in the eastern areas of Crete about
100 BC, alarming everyone of her presence. She quickly became infamous and feared due
to her alien appearance and abilities.

After having lived through hell on earth for 2000 years, she got picked up by TLF chief
Jackson, bringing her to Terrahypt, and preventing her to cause further chaos on Earth.

Currently, Alia and her family live together as nomads on Terrahypt. She however does not
reside with her family all the time, she likes to explore and wander alone around Terrahypt
and interact with the inhabitants. She sporadically tries to help them with physical work, like
moving large objects. Alia is very selfish. She rarely does any favours, she likes to see
people work independently without focusing too much on her presence.

Alia shows great interest in meeting other Thilians, such as Herea, her love interest. She is
obsessed with the breasts of other Thilians, which is one of her typical traits as an Edmyron.
She often likes to stalk unsuspecting Thilians and surprise them with mischievous intentions.
