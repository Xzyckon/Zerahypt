Sir. Evan Carbondyle. Is a man of great success. A human from Earth who has immigrated to
Terrahypt during the 2000 year earth recuperation era after the Yluxa event. He came to the
Zerzek with knowledge of steam and victorian industrialism.

Evan pioneered the idea of attaching steam generators to a wheeled chassis, which would
later on give birth to Fecudas. He owns a wide span of land on the Jaédish countryside
where he mainly focuses on giving the human public free real estate.

He by no wonder owns the Carbondyle company of which manufactures a wide selection of
steam-powered vehicles. Such vehicles include, Fecudas, Spiffers and Sand Cruisers. He
also has a military division that builds battle vehicles, although these vehicles are mainly for
domestic defense as they perform best on pavement.

Evan's personal life is currently free from his supervisory job as an industry tycoon. He
spends his placid evenings in his great mansion on the verdant hills of Jaédryon. Evan is a
man of manners. Although he has a high tolerance for unclassy behaviour, he sternly
enforces good behaviour on his grounds. Over the years, Evan has grown as thick as an oak
trunk. So he has erected badminton courts on his turf to help him get in shape, of which he
thoroughly enjoys. Though he keeps botching up his exercise plans up with marzipan pastries.
