Abia is a second generation Cytonian who has adopted the humanoid shape that Targilin, her
creator, has become fond of. Abia has spent the majority of her early life building and
assisting with the progress of the Kabrian Omnire.

She is specifically talented in the construction of temples and massive town squares. With a
side-hobby of spaceship design. Recently from the incident of the natural reserve, Terrahypt,
Abia has assisted with the reconstruction and gathering of information while it was stationed
close to Earth.

She has taken interest in some of its cultures, and took in a handful of humans to carry out
some experiments on. From her actions, she has created a human sub-species called:
Plastmen. Many of these Plastmen have established factions of which either worship or
despise Abia. Two prominent examples are the Al-Atiba and the Slavuics, a set of factions
that has been in war with each other ever since the dawn of Plastmen.

Abia is a reserved Cytonian compared to Tyg and Targilin. But she is more evil in a traditional
sense. She swindles and ruins the lives of people, especially of those who has little power in
terms of business and fame. Abia has little care for people, but she cares for those who has
the ability to make a difference. Many see her as the God of Business. This also means that
she has competitors, like the president of Dutvutan.
