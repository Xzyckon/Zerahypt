John Kontsley, or Yonk, is a human who originated from Earth that now lives and works as a
covert operator on Terrahypt. Back on Earth, he was an Irish fisherman that worked full-time.
But when the first world war broke out, he went through several complications that led him to
take his trawler far out into the atlantic ocean and got capsized.

After spending a long time on the exposed keel of his ship, he got rescued by a large
bypassing ship that turned out to be a Terrahyptian shuttle in disguise, taking him to
Terrahypt on its last mission on Earth. While on Terrahypt, he got exposed to a plethora of
new and great things. Such as healthcare that can prolong a human's life indefinately,
affordable housing, and very practical technology.

Although there is essentially no fishing industry on Terrahypt, John has become very
interested in its prevalent agent-work that many people are employed in. John's current field
of expertise is Surgical Offense Covert Operator, which compels him to track, stalk, report
and sometimes execute his target. He is also tasked to do rescue missions where he takes
his versatile executive vehicles to make surprise attacks which disorients the opposition so
he can use it to his advantage.

John is by no means a coward, even if he fails, he uses his brash and overpowering attitude
to intimidate his foes. He is smart and is no stranger to trickery. He often gets the last laugh
in small social bouts because of his human perseverance, which is more or less uncommon
on Terrahypt.
