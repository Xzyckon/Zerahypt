Herea is an Athnian Ceiphian who is part of the Obsyas clan. There she works as a courier,
transporting valuable goods between towns under the Obsyas trade division.

Herea is a burly Thilian who can single handedly fend off intrusive thieves and pirates who
are after her precious booty. And she barely uses any guns to fight. She could simply use a
small pebble as a projectile, using her toes or fingers to flick it into her attackers' forehead
and stun them.

Having lived for more than a thousand years, her techniques of dealing with her adversaries
are more playful than serious. Because even if an entire ships' crew attacks her, dealing with
them seriously would only make it a chore. Herea is seldom serious in her every day life. She
likes to playfully wrestle with some of the people at the ports where she starts her courier
missions. And even though she does not possess any guns, she likes to engage in fire
practice with the gunners.

During her free time when there's no missions to do, she likes to laze and interact with snyfs.
And due to her popularity among Thilians, some like to pay her a visit and make snyfs for her
to enjoy. Some Thilians have her as an idol even and want to follow her on her voyages. But
she advises them not to since being an Athnian, her maternal instincts will only distract her.
