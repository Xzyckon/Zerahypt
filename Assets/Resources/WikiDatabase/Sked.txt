Sked Onkin Mc. Fergin, is a plastman who is the second CEO of the Helior company. He
lives in a humble little village within Ja√©den, close to the Helior headquarters, making his
daily commute to the company rather snappy.

His father, Heli, who is the founder of the Helior company passed his status to Sked as a
desperate attempt on keeping the company intact after his retirement. Sked, on the other
hand had little knowledge about this company; "Heli Ordnance". Judging by the name, Sked
tried his best on coming up with ideas and practices to fit his father's company, even though
he knew nothing about weapons or ordnance.

Although Sked is pretty adept at designing automobiles and Terrahyptian hovercrafts. He
designed self-propelled vessels that holds the guns that the Helior company is famous for.
Suffice to say, Sked has been doing ok as the CEO of Helior. However, he has been inspired
by the usage of excessively large weaponry, even hand-held ones.

Sked has a pistol which fires a disproportionately large round. He uses this as a form of
deterrent, but also as a trump card due to its devastating impact on whatever is unfortionate
to be hit by it, also due to its rather inaccurate trajectory. Very little is known about how he's
able to handle the recoil of such an absurd sidearm. But as a plastman, Sked is heavily
dependant on a type of alcoholic tea-like beverage that keeps him in check. Many plastmen
such as Sked likes alcoholic beverages due to its medicinal properties, such as
anti-spontaneous combustion.
