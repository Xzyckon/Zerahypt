Tothler is an ESE who resides on Dutvutan. He is an inventor and a weapons manufacturer.
His former life was also centered around making weapons. He was a pioneer of coil weaver
technology, a type of subsystem for ranged plasma weapons that shapes the bolts to make
them last longer through flight.

His birthplace was on Zerana during the second terrahyptian golden age. He was a Sikaiter,
working for both his own kind and the rest of the Terrahyptian populace, although limited. He
died during the great retaking of Mevy by an attacker who shot him with one of his own
manufactured weapons.

After his death, Tothler reincarnated on Dutvutan, bringing his knowledge to the Dutvutanian
military. Even if they already have weapons that is more superior, he has exploited a small
niche market that provide for people who are part of a militia or just commoners who simply
needs a weapon.

Tothler is a person who seldom speaks, only when he needs to clarify his intentions. He is
not necessarily reclusive, he often asks if he could improve on something, even suggest his
services on whatever item that interests him. He has a pretty staunch ideology. He treats his
weapons career very seriously, and he does not want his products to go unused. Even his
old designs are reworked to be used in modern systems.

If there is anything he hates the most, it has to be the fact that his killer was using a Tothler
Tygria M1, a trashed prototype.
