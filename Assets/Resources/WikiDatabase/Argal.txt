Argal is an ancient Hyptian who is serving the Agrians as their most important Hyptian
representative. He is by no stretch of the imagination a powerful Agrian official due to the
overall overpowered status that the Agrians have in general, but Argal is nonetheless the
most powerful Agrian Hyptian there is.

Like Azfelgharz, Argal is respected by the Kabrian Omnire for his intelligence and sense of
law and order, more so than his close friend Azfelgharz. Argal is a devout scholar of the laws
and methods that the Kabrians act out within their territories.

Not only is Argal liked by the Agrians on Terrahypt for his trustworthy character, he has also
brought some new designs into fruition regarding new Agrian vessels. These include the
widespread Motus and the Helirotor-type automatons that patrol the Agrian deserts. His lack
of lower legs is due to the vast Agrian infrastructure which is difficult to move around in,
especially for a non-Thilian. He has replaced them with a pair of powerful hover devices,
erasing his need to walk and climb.

Argal today usually takes his personal Helirotor vessel out on patrol duties, getting in touch
with the anarchic populace that inhabit the lawless deserts. As a Hyptian, he wants to
maintain a positive connection with even the most ruthless people there. It's not like they
have a choice, because Agrians in general have total control over Terrahypt. Argal likes being
in power over the inhabitants of the desert. He has access to one of the most powerful
automatons in the Agrian arsenal, the "Agru". And he deploys it whenever there's some
lessons to be taught.
