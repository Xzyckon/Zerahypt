Perynna is an Overseer who specializes in looking after and documenting the sentient fauna
of Kabrian worlds such as Raidyutan, Terrahypt, Cytrihypt, etc.

Ever since her childhood, she loved the unique and diverse races of the Thilian species.
More specifically the small and peculiar kind she has seen during her voyages with the
school she attended. This school often went out on trips to Kabrian planets as a way to form
friendly bonds with the native Thilians on these worlds.

Perynna is a curious soul, even exessively so. She liked to escape from her group in order to
peer into the deeper society of the small and adorable. Being an anodian, her uncommon
buxom features have developed as a result of her constant exposure to the cute little Thilians
she has met.

With her friendly attitude, she has been recieving a lot of support from other organizations
who dearly required a pacifist solution to deal with "small" problems. She has a partner who
helps her a lot with the missions she embarks on. And this person is Myssi, a Corsubuk
Tygriessa who she found with almost no purpose on Dutvutan.

Perynna also has a colleague named Pirizuka who assists her with technical problems she is
faced with as an overseer. Unlike her, Perynna is pretty knowledgeable in navigation, which
makes them both rather compatible as work partners.
