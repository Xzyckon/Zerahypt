Pazuka is a Thilian who lives in Cyecos. She's a hermit who survives independently on her
Zerzek, situated on the perilous cliff corners of the Cyecean coasts.

She is the second child of Corsudra, a strong and virile Thilian of whom Pazuka inherits the
most likeness to. She's physically fit and exceedingly strong compared to normal Thilians.
Although she has all this strength, she mainly uses it for recreational purposes, like dancing
and sport competitions.

Unlike her sister Pirizuka, she has no occupation. She hasn't found herself to be useful in
work situations because she's in constant need of energy to fuel her already frivolous
behaviour. She's even worse than Pirizuka when it comes to focusing. But she does have
better awareness when it comes to her judgement. This makes Pazuka very blunt and

Pazuka is an extrovert who sometimes visits people despite her remote location. While there,
she's the center of attention due to her dominance in a social setting, and she pretty much
decides on what to do, leaving little to be improved. She forces them into competitions of
which she keeps winning at. This is mainly her wanting to feel good about herself. She
dislikes things that are unpredictable, like another person's decisions. This however has
made her a target for potential jesters who enter her games just to make her lose solely 
from frustration.
