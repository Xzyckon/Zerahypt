Beja is a Snyssian mixbreed who works as an alloy blacksmith. She has made countless
experimental metals and materials that have both failed and become successful; some of
which are even used up til now.

But she's mainly known as the first creator of the Bejsirf. She got the brilliant idea to attach 2
disproportionately large cruiser engines to a small cockpit which propelled the craft almost up
to 500 km/h. She nearly died in the process, but the discovery prompted others to build on
the idea and improve on it, making her brand the most popular hovercraft on Terrahypt.

Beja is very creative, she makes swords, knives and shields. And she sometimes dabbles in
making traditional machines that're driven by springs, cogs and pressure tanks. She lives on
her Zerzek together with her employees, forging high-quality metals for custom made vehicle
parts and other tools.

She is friendly, but quiet in her actions. She almost never tries to get the attention of
someone who isn't working under her own supervision. Beja has poor social memory and
can not remember most peoples needs, even their names. With her long life and experience,
she is still a troublemaker if she is let out of her Zerzek. She knows almost nothing about the
rules and customs of the world, even when being taught extensively. She is known for stealing 
valuable things in order for her to know more about them, even overtly dangerous things.
