Ruchalus is a Major Proto-Thilian who has become corrupt with tyrannical motives and
radical ideologies. He was among the first ever creations which sprung out from the very first
humanoid entity Tyg has made. And one of their first missions was to make sure that Tygs
influence was kept separate from Earth's ecosystem.

From this special task, Ruchalus had to assimilate the humans who experienced Tygs
actions into a separate society. These humans eventually evolved to be the modern day
Terrahyptians. After the Yluxa incident, Ruchalus was adamantly against the introduction of
Thilians repopulating Terrahypt. Since he had decided on making it be primarily a human

Ruchalus has always been a stern advocate for totalitarianism. He coerces everyone around
him, especially those who he deems to be inferior, which in this case is the human species.
He has a strong unconditional bond with all Thilians. And he will usually flirt and act in a
charitable way to gain their trust.

Ruchalus is an active fighter who engages in long brawls. He's violent and regularly
intimidates people. Eventually, the Terrahyptian government decided to banish him from
making any contact with the rest of the Hyptian Zerzek. He is now held imprisoned within his
abode. An ancient fortress built into the south wall of the Soburuke mountain range. It is not
known what he is performing within. But his hordes of monstrous machines, and the outbreak
of svibra gives a clue that he hasn't changed.
