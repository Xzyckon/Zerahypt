Azfelgharz is an ancient Hyptian from the very first generation back on Earth. He stood out
from the still maturing species to the Thilians who were fostering them. He had exceptional
wit, sense of discipline and foresight.

His intelligence is what shaped him to be one of the most respected Hyptians to the Kabrian
Omnire. He has very close ties with the Agrians and many other Thilian officials. Not only is
Azfelgharz clever, he has the very rare privlege of wielding the great powers of Svibra; a
Kabrian medium of manipulating the elements. With this power, he can perform things that
looks nothing short of wizardry to the untrained eye.

Azfelgharz can cast beams of plasma, generate shields of matter out of thin air, and move
heavy objects from afar. He is also well built, where a close quarters assailant will see more
castings of fists than castings of magic. During his very long lifetime, he has worked himself
up to presidenthood. He controls and represents the Terrahyptian civilization.

He lives and works at the very top of the Azal tower, which is where the most elite executives
live. He's second in power over Terrahypt right under Terrana, the empress. But Azfelgharz
still holds most of the authority over the Hyptian side of the Terrahyptian populace. Most
significant political matters go through him first, because keeping a healthy partnership with
the Kabrians is one of the very few things that keeps his people from descending into
uncivilized anarchy.
